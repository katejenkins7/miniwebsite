            <p>This summer, I took advantage of my time in the beautiful province of New Brunswick and went on a weekend hiking trip at Mount Carleton Provincial Park. New Brusnwick has several extraordinary parks, but this one exceeded my expectations and in my opinion, really stands out from the rest.</p>
          <p>The park is located in Saint-Quentin, New Brunswick and it takes roughly four hours to drive there from my hometown of Riverview, New Brunswick. The park features numerous trails, campgrounds, and water activities for those looking to make the most out of their trip.</p>

            <h2>Hiking Mount Carleton</h2>
            <p>For me, this experience was unlike any I have ever had as Mount Carleton is the highest peak in all of the Maritime Provinces. Travellers come from all over the world to experience this as part of the International Appalachian Trail.</p>

              </figure>
              <p>It took my friends and I several hours to reach the peak of the mountain. Once we got to the top, we took a couple minutes to rest and enjoy the scenery around us. Unfortunately, we did not have much time at the top as it was the early evening and we wanted to ensure we got back down before dark.</p>
              <p>One would think that this would be the most difficult hike in the entire park, but Mount Sagamook actually wins in that regard.</p>
              <h2>Hiking Mount Sagamook</h2>

              <p>The Mount Sagamook trail is the most strenuous hike in the park and requires several hours to complete. The terrain is much harder to navigate and it is extremely steep. It is important to monitor the weather for the day you choose to complete this hike as it can become unsafe in wet or foggy conditions.</p>
    <p>If you plan on taking this route, it is imperative that you bring enough water and wear proper footwear. Having hiked Mount Carleton the day prior, my friends and I felt a little bit more prepared and had an idea of what to expect. If Mount Sagamook is your first or only choice for hiking, I would suggest reading reviews or asking for advice from others who have hiked the trail.</p>
              
              <p>Mount Sagamook is certainly labeled for more experienced hikers, but do not let this intimidate you from trying it out. While it might take you a little longer to get to the top, it is important to keep in mind that the views from the peak are worth it!</p>
