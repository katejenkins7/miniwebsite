              <h1>Biography</h1>
              <img src= "images/Kate.jpg"alt= "This is a photo of Kate Jenkins, the author of this website"
            <p>My name is Kate Jenkins and I am a student in the Digital Journalism Program at the University of Ottawa. I am currently in my final year of school and wanted to go on an adventure before returning to my normal schedule in the city.</p>
              <p>During my summer break, I took the opportunity to travel back to my hometown of Riverview, New Brunswick given that my work had moved entirely online as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the cases in my home province remained steadily lower, I felt it was a safer option that would allow me to spend time with my loved ones.  </p>
            <p> As it was recommended that people limit their travel between provinces to help reduce the spread of the virus, I spent most of my summer exploring New Brunswick more than I have ever have. My silver lining from this pandemic is that I was able to discover these beautiful new places and develop a deeper love for where I come from. </p>
              <p>I hope you enjoy the photos from my weekend trip to Mount Carleton Provincial Park and other pictures and testimonials from places I explored a little bit closer to home!</p>
